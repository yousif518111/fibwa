### fibwa, This repository aims to keep Fire boy and watergirl, one of the most iconic flash games to exist, archived and kept available to the public in the swf format instead of the new converted to html5.

The launcher offers a simple interface with buttons that launch the game using the old adobe flash player app.

The repository is only aimed at windows although you are free to get the swf files from here

you have the ability to reset the games back and reset progress since the game doesnt offer it, i plan on making this launcher better over time, please report any bugs to yousif51811@gmail.com
